## Docker Image

The TimeSheetGenerator application is also provided in a Docker image including all runtime dependencies. This allows running the TimeSheetGenerator without having to install a LaTeX distribution. The Docker image is provided as part of the regular releases in this GitHub repository. Additionally we provide a script to simplify the use of the Docker image, for example copying the necessary files in a temporary directory, which is then mounted in the Docker container. This allows for the input and output files to be placed anywhere on your file system, as you would expect.

### Installation

- download the `docker.zip` file from the latest release
- unzip the archive
- find the extracted Docker image and the script to run it
- install the Docker image with `docker load -i <image_name.tar.gz>`
- place the script anywhere you like

### Execution with Script

`sh ./run_docker_build_pdf.sh [-v] <global json> <month json> <output pdf>`

`.\run_docker_build_pdf.cmd [-v] <global json> <month json> <output pdf>`

The input and output arguments are full paths and the files do not need to be placed in a special directory.

### Execution without Script

`docker run --rm -v <directory>:/prod/src timesheetgenerator:latest [-v] <global json> <month json> <output pdf>`

Without the script the input and output paths are relative to the specified directory. Remember that the specified directory will be mounted in the Docker container.
